# Ashwin's Unified Portfolio

This repository contains the evaluation of my portfolio website.

## Structure

- **`v2-glassmorphic/`**: The current, modern version of the portfolio (Glassmorphic design).
- **`v1-legacy/`**: The previous version of the portfolio (React-based).
- **`dist/`**: The build output directory (generated by `build_unified.sh`).

## Building

To build both versions and prepare them for deployment, run:

```bash
sh build_unified.sh
```

This will create a `dist` directory with:

- `index.html` (v2)
- `v1/` (v1)

## Deployment

The `dist` folder is ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages.
